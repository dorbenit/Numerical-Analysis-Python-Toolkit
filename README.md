# Numerical Analysis Final Project ‚Äì Python Implementations

This project is a comprehensive collection of five numerical analysis tasks, written in Python, as part of an academic course in Numerical Analysis.  
Each assignment showcases a different technique or algorithmic concept implemented from scratch under strict constraints (no use of `solve`, `roots`, `interpolate`, etc.), and focuses on **efficiency**, **correctness**, and **algorithmic design**.

A core emphasis throughout the project was on **high numerical precision** and **optimized runtime** ‚Äî each solution was carefully planned with algorithmic thinking and iterative refinement to meet these criteria.

> In several tasks, **multiple implementation options** were developed and tested side-by-side (e.g., spline vs. barycentric interpolation, bisection vs. secant), as part of the author‚Äôs process of evaluating efficiency, accuracy, and algorithmic behavior.

## üß∞ Project Utilities

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The following utility files were provided by the course staff.  
> These are not part of the author's original code, but they are necessary for the correct execution and testing of several assignments.

- `commons.py`: Includes test functions (with and without noise), constants, and shared evaluation logic
- `functionUtils.py`: Provides decorators for noise injection, timeouts, and random seeding
- `sampleFunctions.py`: Contains function generators, shape classes (e.g. `BezierShape`, `Polygon`), and sample callable test functions

These are essential especially for **Assignment 3‚Äì5**, where function evaluation and shape estimation depend on shared behaviors across tasks.

## üß† Assignment Highlights

### üîπ Assignment 1: Interpolation
Implements **cubic spline interpolation** (tridiagonal system, Thomas algorithm) and an optimized **barycentric interpolation** using Chebyshev nodes.  
The solution was optimized to achieve **O(n)** time complexity, with the barycentric approach outperforming splines on most real-world tests.

### üîπ Assignment 2: Finding Intersections
Solves for the **intersection points** between two continuous functions.  
An adaptive combination of **bisection**, **secant**, and logic inspired by **Brent‚Äôs algorithm** ensures fast convergence even in noisy or non-linear cases.

> Modular design includes a simpler fallback method (pure bisection) and automated comparison of accuracy/runtime.

### üîπ Assignment 3: Numerical Integration & Area Between Curves
Efficient implementation of **adaptive Simpson‚Äôs Rule** for definite integration, with handling of edge cases (`n=1`, odd `n`).  
Calculates area between two curves by integrating between intersection points.

> Smart reuse of previous functions + precision control with `float32` + iterative accuracy loop

### üîπ Assignment 4: Polynomial Fitting
Performs **least squares polynomial fitting** of arbitrary degree using QR-based matrix construction and normal equations.  
Includes dynamic validation of polynomial degree against fitting errors.

> Implementation respects the constraint of not using `numpy.polyfit` or `lstsq`.

### üîπ Assignment 5: Shape Fitting and Area Estimation
Given noisy (x,y) points from an unknown shape, the algorithm estimates area using:
- **Bezier curves** or **circle fitting**
- Time-constrained adaptive sampling
- Abstract class-based design

> Efficient handling of noise, timeout logic, and generalization to different geometric shapes

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- (optional) tqdm for progress bars during testing

> Some test cases were designed independently by the author, as the official grader used by the course was not shared in this repository.
